# Financial Tracker/Accounting Ledger Application

## Description of the Project

In this project, you will use what you have learned about Java programming to
create a CLI application. With this application you can track all financial
transactions for a business or for personal use.
All transactions in the application should be read from and saved to a transaction
file named transactions.csv. Each transaction should be saved as a single
line.


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to choose between adding a deposit, adding a payment, viewing the ledger, or exiting the application from the home menu.
- As a user, I want to receive immediate feedback, so I can understand what to do next.
